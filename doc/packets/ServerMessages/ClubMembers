Notes:
// The status value is 'Server' (1) when a member is online in a different server,
// and the id represents the id of that server.
// This status was never used on the original game (at least not in the HK version).

// The status value is 'Room' (2) when a member is online in this server,
// and the id represents the id of the room where the member is playing,
// or zero if the member is in the main lobby.

// I do not currently know what the status 'Team' (3) stands for.
